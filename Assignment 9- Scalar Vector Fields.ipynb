    "The __purpose__ of the following code is to derive an equation for the __accumulation__ of a species as a result of __diffusion.__ In other words, we are aiming to get an equation that will tell us how much of a substance over time (accumulation) has entered an area, as the result of movement of a species due to random motion of defects and chemical forces (diffusion). This code is intended for those who have learned the basics of calculus (theory behind derivatives) and those that wish to learn how movement of substances across any kind of medium is modeled mathematically.
